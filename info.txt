# Bash for Beginners

## Overview

These Microsoft Developer YouTube series is designed to help get you up to speed on Bash.  

These three series on Channel 9 and YouTube are designed to help get you up to speed on Bash. Bash is considered a universal language when it comes to cloud computing and programming. Many languages support Bash commands to pass data and information and when it comes to the Cloud, all platforms support using it to interact with your environment. 

Even though we won't cover everything there is to know about this language in this course, we want to make sure we give you the foundation on scripting in Bash. At the end of the course, you'll be able to create your own scripts and automate tasks with the help of Bash. 

### What you'll learn

- What is a terminal 
- Setting up our environment 
- Getting help 
- Navigating the Bash terminal 
- Listing content 
- Finding files 
- Working with directories and files 
- Viewing files  
- Environment variables 
- Redirection and Pipelines 
- Modifying File permissions 
- What is a Bash script? 
- What are variables in Bash? 
- What are Conditional Statements in Bash? 
- What Are Case Statements In Bash? 
- What are Functions in Bash? 
- What are Loops in Bash? 
- How to write a Bash Script 

## Prerequisites

- [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) Azure is only used in the last video. We will be deploying a resource group.
- [GitHub codespaces](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-11-09-codespaces-for-free-and-pro-accounts/) Included in your GitHub account. 

## Resources

As the goal of these courses is to help get you up to speed on Bash. The next step after completing the videos is to follow a tutorial! Here are a few of our favorites:

- [Quickstart for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell](https://aka.ms/QuickStartForBashAzure1)
- [Learn to use Bash with the Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/BashWithAzureCLI1)
- [Create a Linux virtual machine in Azure](https://aka.ms/LinuxVirtualMachineAzure1)
